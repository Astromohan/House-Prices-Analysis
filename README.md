# House-Prices-Analysis

<b>About:</b>

The dataset used in this project is an ongoing Kaggle competition based on the ’Ames Housing Dataset ‘of Dean De Cook. The dataset describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.

<b>Objective:</b>

The prediction of house prices is an essential and important part in the real estate world as there is a lot of money involved in the buying and selling of houses. An accurate prediction of house prices is of high importance for the seller and the prospective buyers. 

For a learner and an aspiring data analyst like myself, the presence of the many features present in the dataset, offered a lot of room for data analysis, feature engineering and exploration of algorithms which made the project engaging and allowed to compare different techniques and models present in the machine learning domain.
